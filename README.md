# Pomodoro + Metronome + Ambient Workspace App

Hi! I‚Äôm Towhidul Islam Shrabon (you can call me Shrabon, or find me online as **tishrabon**). This project is a focused productivity tool that combines:

- A **customizable Pomodoro timer**
- A **metronome with adjustable BPM**
- **Natural ambient sounds** for a calming workspace

You can control your Pomodoro cycles, adjust tempo, enjoy background sounds, or run them together for the perfect flow! All inside a minimal, intuitive interface.

---

## How to Use

- **Customize** your Pomodoro session durations and labels.
- **Set** your preferred BPM for the metronome and pick your tick sound.
- **Choose** ambient sounds to shape the atmosphere.
- Start the clock, toggle the metronome or ambient sounds, and manage sessions using the reset, play/pause, or renew buttons.

Simple controls, no hassle.

## Limitations

This project is hosted for free, so:

- Audio file sizes are limited.
- Freesound.org API has request limits. If you hit the limit, ambient sounds may pause until requests reset.

Thanks for understanding!
